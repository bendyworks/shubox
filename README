=> EXPO - A test-driven Ruby learning environment

	Expo gives you a way to bootstrap your test-driven learning by giving you a basic infrastructure in which
	to work: A directory structure, some classes and unit tests to get started, and a Rakefile. 

	See http://www.bobbynorton.com/?p=36 if you haven't already seen the background material on what 
	test-driven learning is all about.
	
	
=> Learning by Testing

	If you're completely new to Ruby, you should start with "Ruby in Twenty Minutes" - 			
	http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/. This will help you get Ruby installed and will 
	explain the basics of Ruby programming.
	
	If you already have Ruby and rake (http://rake.rubyforge.org/files/README.html) installed and you're 
	ready to start, then fire up a command prompt and run the expo's starter tests:

		rake

	This uses the rake TestTask to run all the unit tests in your test folder. If everything goes as planned,
	running this command should produce something like: 

		Loaded suite /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/rake-0.8.4/lib/rake/rake_test_loader
		Started
		...
		Finished in 0.000706 seconds.

		3 tests, 4 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors
 
	Open up the test cases in your favorite editor and have a look at what's going on. Change the tests. Add
	some new cases. Run them again every time you want to experiment with something new. Make sure you run 
	all the tests in your suite before you check in at the end of your session.
	
	If you don't yet have a copy of Pickaxe, get one (http://www.pragprog.com/titles/ruby/programming-ruby). 
	Add to your expo repository as you read through the book to code up examples of what you're reading.
