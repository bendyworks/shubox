= tbox - A test-driven learning sandbox creation tool

* See http://www.bobbynorton.com/?p=36 for more on tbox and test-driven learning.

== Description: 

tbox lowers the barrier to entry for test-driven learning by providing a basic infrastructure in which 
to start coding: A directory structure, some classes and unit tests to get started, and a Rakefile to run
all tests. For now, tbox is geared toward Ruby, though the technique is applicable to any language that 
lends itself to TDD.
	
== Learning Ruby by Testing:

If you're completely new to Ruby, you should start with "Ruby in Twenty Minutes" - 			
http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/. This will help you get Ruby installed and will 
explain the basics of Ruby programming.

If you already have Ruby and rake (http://rake.rubyforge.org/files/README.html) installed and you're 
ready to start, then fire up a command prompt and run the starter tests that ship with tbox:

	$ cd ~/ruby_projects
  	$ tbox learning_ruby
	$ rake

This uses the rake TestTask to run all the unit tests in your test folder. If everything goes as planned,
running this command should produce something like: 

	Loaded suite /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/rake-0.8.4/lib/rake/rake_test_loader
	Started
	...
	Finished in 0.000706 seconds.

	3 tests, 4 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors

Open up the test cases in your favorite editor and have a look at what's going on. Change the tests. Add
some new cases. Run them again every time you want to experiment with something new. Make sure you run 
all the tests in your suite before you check in at the end of your session.

If you don't yet have a copy of Pickaxe, get one (http://www.pragprog.com/titles/ruby/programming-ruby). 
Add to your tbox repository as you read through the book to code up examples of what you're reading.
