Description:

tbox lowers the barrier to entry for test-driven learning by providing a basic infrastructure in which 
to start coding: A directory structure, some classes and unit tests to get started, and a Rakefile to run
all tests. For now, tbox is geared toward Ruby, though the technique is applicable to any language that 
lends itself to TDD.
  
Usage:
  
$ cd ~/ruby_projects
$ tbox learning_ruby
$ rake
