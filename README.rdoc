== DESCRIPTION:

tbox lowers the barrier to entry for test-driven learning* by providing a basic infrastructure in which 
to start coding: A directory structure, some classes and unit tests to get started, and a Rakefile to run
all tests. For now, tbox is geared toward Ruby, though the technique is applicable to any language that 
lends itself to TDD.

== BASIC USAGE:

Go to the folder where you want to create your new test sandbox, and run the <code>tbox</code> command to generate your test scaffolding.

<code>$ cd ~/ruby_projects</code>

<code>$ tbox learning_ruby</code>

<code>$ rake</code>

== SYNOPSIS:

tbox is built using newgem. Although tbox was initially designed with Ruby and Test::Unit in mind, new generator 
scripts can easily be added to support other testing techniques in multiple languages. tbox can therefore become 
a starting point for test-driven learning in any language with any dependencies.

== REQUIREMENTS:

* newgem

== INSTALL:

The <code>tbox</code> application is distributed as a RubyGem and is available immediately after installation.

<code>$ gem sources -a http://gems.github.com (you only have to do this once)</code>

<code>$ sudo gem install bobbyno-tbox</code>

Alternately, download the gem and install manually from github.
